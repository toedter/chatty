[[overview]]
== Overview

[[overview-introduction]]
=== Introduction
This guide provides you with a detailed description how to use the RESTful Chatty service. You will
also find a short introduction in the link:getting-started-guide.html[Getting Started Guide].

[[overview-http-verbs]]
=== HTTP verbs

Chatty tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource (complete update)

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource (partial updates)

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
=== HTTP status codes

Chatty tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===

[[overview-headers]]
=== Headers

Every response has the following header(s):

include::{snippets}/headers-example/response-headers.adoc[]

[[overview-errors]]
=== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >== 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to apply a non-existent user will produce a
`400 Bad Request` response:

include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[overview-hypermedia]]
=== Hypermedia

Chatty's RESTful web service uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)]
format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate

[[resources-index]]

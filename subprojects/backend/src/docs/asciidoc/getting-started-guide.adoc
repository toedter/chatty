[introduction]
= Introduction

Chatty provides a RESTful web service for creating and storing users and chat messages. It uses hypermedia
to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.

= Getting started

[getting-started-running-the-service]
== Running the service
Chatty is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/toedter/chatty
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd chatty
$ ./gradlew clean build
$ ./gradlew bootrun
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/index/1/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response in the
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)] format:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.



[getting-started-creating-a-user]
== Creating a user
Now that you've started the service and verified that it works, the next step is to use
it to create a new user. As you saw above, the URI for working with users is included as
a link when you perform a `GET` request against the root of the service:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

To create a user, you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI including a JSON
payload containing the title and body of the user:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-user/1/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created user:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-user/1/http-response.adoc[]

To work with the newly created user you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example,
you can access the user's details by performing a `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-user/2/curl-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the user's details in its body:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-user/2/http-response.adoc[]
